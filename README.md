# Computer networks project
<p>Computer networks have a significant impact on the working of an
organization. An efficient network is essential to facilitate the systematic
transfer of information in an organization in the form of messages, files,
and resources. The project provides insights into various concepts such
as topology design, IP address configuration, and how to send
information in the form of packets to the wireless networks of different
areas</p>
This project aims to design the topology of the network using the Cisco
Packet Tracer with the implementation of wireless networking systems.<br><br>
This network consists of the following devices:
<ul>
<li>Router-PT</li>
<li>Switch 2960-24TT</li>
<li>PC-PT</li>
<li>Different Wires</li>
</ul>
The design includes the following parts of the Network:
<ul>
<li>Blocks A, B, C, D, E. F with two computers in each block</li>
<li>The main block of routers</li>
</ul>
